"Heart-risk-prediction-Project" 
Welcome to Heart Disease Prediction Data Science Project

1. About the project:
---------------------------
This project is the simplest project that gives a basic idea to the user what exactly "data visualization" is.
It helps the user understand the packages used in python for building the GUI front end and the plots for
data visualization presented in the form of a Quiz that is capable of predicting the "Heart disease risk rate"
of the quiz participant. This predicted value (shown in the python terminal) can be compared and verified
with the data visualization plots that are plotted serially on a set of output windows.


2. How to run the project?
----------------------------------
-> The file "### FINAL HEART DISEASE QUIZ ###.py" must be executed in command pmt
or terminal to run the GUI version of the quiz. Once the 1st window opens, close it to move to the
next window of the quiz and continue the process to reach the end of the visualization.
-> The file "HealthQuiz html version" can be run to open the quiz in html text format on the 
browser window in order to get an idea of the quiz contents.
-> The files "accuracy.py", "graphdemo.py", "Exploration File 1.py" and "Exploration File 2.py"
are extra files that gives the user the freedom to explore variations of implementable code for further
visualization.
-> The file "NEWDATA.csv" contains the Excel Comma separated Variable file that contains the data related
to 300 heart disease records which helps in estimating the Quiz participant's heart disease risk by data 
visualization.
